Purpose:
To demonstrate how adaptive attack scripts can be used to create and launch sequence of attacks.
And also adapt the sequence according to the result of previous attack.

2015 Ukraine Power Grid Attack is used to demonstrate this feature.
The network is an abstract representation, consisting of Corporate, SCADA, Grid and Call Center networks.

                                [PLC]

1. A corporate network with 2 firewall nodes, 3 User nodes and 1 server node.
2. A SCADA network with 1 HMI, 1 UPS and 1 PLC nodes.
3. A Grid network with 3 grid stations and 1 HMI node.
4. A Call center network with 4 customer service representatives.
5. An external network with 3 attacker nodes.
6. Another external network with 2 customer nodes.

Adaptive Attack Scripts:
1. Grid Shutdown: Purpose of this script is to gain access on important nodes via phishing and vulnerability attacks
                  and shutdown the grid nodes.
    a. Phishing Email to Corporate Network Users.
    b. If the phishing email is successful, a root access attack is initiated on the victim.
    c. If the root access attack fails, a user access attack is initiated on the same victim.
    d. If the user access attack is successful then the failed root access attack is initiated again.
    e. If now the root access attack is successful then a network scan is initiated for the SCADA and the grid network.
    f. A different root access attack is initiated on the IP-addresses found in the network scan.
    h. Similar to point c and d, sequence of root and user access attack are used to gain root access on the scanned nodes.
    i. The nodes where root access is successful a node shutdown attack is initiated.
    j. The nodes get shutdown if they have the required vulnerability.

2. Call Center DOS Attack: Purpose of this script is to initiate distributed DOS attack on the call center nodes
                           so that the Customer nodes cannot connect to the customer service representatives to
                           report the power failure.
    a. A network scan is initiated for the Call Center Network network.
    b. DOS attacks are initiated from the attacker nodes on the IP-addresses found in the network scan.

How to run the adaptive attack scripts:
1. To run the script attack templates are required. These attack templates are there in the "Attacktemplates.xml".
   Either create the attack templates using the Attack Template Editor or do the following:
   a. Go to the EXata user directory
      (Windows: %HOME%/.exataUserDir/exata_<version>/, Linux: $HOME/.exataUserDir/exata_<version>).
   b. Rename "Attacktemplates.xml" (if present) to "Attacktemplates.old.xml".
   c. Copy "Attacktemplates.xml" from this scenario directory.
   * After the script is executed, delete this copied file "Attacktemplates.xml"
     and rename "Attacktemplates.old.xml" to "Attacktemplates.xml".
2. Execute this scenario in EXataGUI or Scenario Player in emulation mode.
3. Open "Adaptive Attack Manager", browse and open the "GridShutdown.js".
4. Provide the appropriate Timeout time.
5. Launch the script.
6. Click on the "View Log" button to view the log of the attacks.
7. Once the "GridShutdown.js" is finished, launch the "CallCenterDOSAttack.js".
8. Click on the "View Log" button to view the log of the attacks.
