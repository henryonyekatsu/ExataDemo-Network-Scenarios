PURPOSE:-
-------
To test DOS BASIC attack capability and its effect on the victim node.

SCENARIO:-
--------
Node 1, Node 3, Node 4 and Node 5 are connected by wired point to point 
link with Node 2.
Node 5 is sending CBR packets to node 2 started from 20 second to 300 
second with the interval of .1 second.
Four attackers (node 1, node 3, node 4 and node 5) attack victim node 
(node 2) using BASIC DOS attack mode. Attack packets are transmitted 
every 100 
milli seconds.
This effect the number of CBR packets received at node 2.

APPLICATION:
-----------
CBR 5 2 0 3000 0.1S 20S 300S PRECEDENCE 0
DOS 2 4 1 3 4 5 BASIC 8080 0 2047 0.1S 30S 60S

RUN:-
----
Run '<EXATA_HOME>/bin/exata dos_basic_attack.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1.dos_basic_attack.config - EXata configuration input file.
2.dos_basic_attack.app    - EXata configuration file for application input.
3.dos_basic_attack.nodes - EXata node configuration file.
4.dos_basic_attack.expected.stat - EXata statistics collection.
5.dos_basic_attack.display - EXata GUI display configuration file
6.README - This file
